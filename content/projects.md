## Pyguard Python Discord Bot

I build a discord bot in python. It has some basic commands like per server leveling or global leveling. You can find the code on [Github](https://github.com/arbs09/pyguard). The website is [pyguard.top](https://pyguard.arbs09.dev/).

## Watermark Maker

I needed a simple watermark maker, so I just build one myself. You can check it out at [watermarkmaker.serverobot.de](https://watermarkmaker.serverobot.de/). The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/arbs09/watermarkmaker)
