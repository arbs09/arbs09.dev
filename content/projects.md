## Pyguard Python Discord Bot

I build a discord bot in python. It has some basic commands like per server leveling or global leveling. You can find the code on [Github](https://github.com/arbs09/pyguard). The website is [pyguard](https://pyguard.arbs09.dev/).

## Watermark Maker

I needed a simple watermark maker, so I just build one myself. You can check it out at [watermark.arbs09.dev](https://watermark.arbs09.dev/). The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/arbs09/watermarkmaker)
