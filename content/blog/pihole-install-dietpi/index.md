## What even is Pihole?

Pi-hole is a network-level ad blocker that acts as a DNS sinkhole. It blocks ads and trackers across your entire network by intercepting DNS requests for known ad-serving domains.

## Why do I even need a Pihole?

There are several reasons you might want to use Pi-hole:

- Network-wide ad blocking: It blocks ads on all devices, including those that don't support ad-blockers (like smart TVs or mobile apps).
- Privacy: It reduces tracking by blocking known tracker domains.
- Performance: Devices may run faster without loading resource-heavy ads.
