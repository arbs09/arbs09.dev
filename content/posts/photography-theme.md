I wanted to created a website for my photography stuff. So i started building it in [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) (a SSG). Then, I discovered that you can create themes for Zola. I built the site as a separate theme and imported it into a different repository for my photography site ([simplesnap.de](https://simplesnap.de)).
Here are some Screenshots:

I made it public on Codeberg: [codeberg.org/arbs09/photography-theme](https://codeberg.org/arbs09/photography-theme).
